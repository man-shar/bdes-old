<Project Name>:
Availability Status App | Leewayhertz Technologies(Summer Intern 2016)

<Brief>: 
The project was done during Summer Internship at Leewayhertz Technologies. The objective was to design a mobile app (iOS and Android) which helps you to communicate your status of availability to others. The app was designed for those super busy people who are working together in a small team/project who needs to stay in close contact with each other. Using the app they can communicate when they are busy, available and for how long so that they can collaborate together in their work efficiently. What make this app special is its very easy & very simple interface and minimal steps to get the things done. The project was carried out using Lean Approach, whole idea was to design the product quickly understanding and focusing customer value and continuously improve it.
