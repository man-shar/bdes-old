Bless - App concept for Disaster Relief Assistance
<brief>
This project was done as a part of our course Design Methods in our fifth semester. We had to take a live situation at that time to come up with intelligent solutions that can make some difference if applied. 
I took a situation related to post floods and how can we improve those situations. Came up with an app concept as my final solution. This was done with parallel learning of our course Design Methods and so 
took a bit of extra time to understand the concepts and deliver out a solution.
