Adobe Internship : Reimagining the experience of a marketer
<brief>
As a part of my Summer internship at Adobe Systems, Noida, I worked under the Marketing Cloud team, the team responsible for creating B2B marketing solutions. My project statement was open ended at the beginning about re-imagining the experience of the marketer on creating webinars for marketing purposes.
Adobe Connect is an enterprise grade product aimed at providing web conferencing solutions. Most of the users of Adobe Connect are marketers who uses it for conducting Webinars : a tool for fulfilling marketing goals. But inspite of the software’s large use in marketing world, Adobe Connect is not a Marketing Cloud product, and only delivers a good web-conferencing experience, while marketers have other important needs other than a good conferencing tool.

My project was to deliver a concept that can accommodate every marketer’s needs, and to leverage the solutions of Adobe Marketing Cloud and integrate it within the Marketing Cloud.
