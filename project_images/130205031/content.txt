<project title> Alloom - System design project
An interesting challenge that we explored through this project was to design an intervention for an yet unexplored user group. Through literature research the user group that we identified was the Handloom Weavers of Sualkuchi, Assam.
A systematic design research approach was followed through out the project. The designed system would reduce the exploitation by middlemen via integration of fair trade and transparency in the system. This will also give the customers flexibility in ordering unique handloom products.
